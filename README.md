# Interactive-Rating
Interactive rating template that collects the rating and sends back thank you reply confirmation.

## Overview

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

My approach was to work on a solution relying on DOM element manipulation and rendering a new div containing the requested format of the 'Thank you' response to be dynamic based on submited rating.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:


- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- Receive response element with the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Javascript
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

- Practice the CSS Flexbox model to reach the desired layout
- used JS to manipulate html elements and render the response

### Deployment

### Continued development

Use this challenge to hone my basic skills on node.js by working on a solution based on HTTP request methods and render the response (HTML) with EJS.
